			<p class="g-pstyle0">Words, of course, never really die. Long after they've been uttered by any living, breathing person, they retire to the Florida of the vocabulary: the crossword puzzle. But now, they'll have one less refuge. And it's the big one, the New York Times puzzle that is the top, the Coliseum, the Louvre Museum of puzzledom. It has been taken over by Mr. Shortz, 41, the head brat of the pack that has been dragging crosswords into the 20th century with clues composed of clever turns of phrases and references as likely to come from MTV as opera.</p>

			<p>At the onset of Will Shortz&rsquo;s assent as the editor of the NYT crossword puzzle was a culture war between crossword veterans and budding puzzle-makers about what should and should not make an appearance in the New York Times Crossword puzzle. Shortz's predecessor, Eugene T. Maleska was a retired English teacher who saw the puzzles as a way to educate people on the intricacies of the English language and fine culture while Shortz felt that the puzzles should be entertaining, rather than educational. He believed that &ldquo;crosswords should reflect the language of the times. In the past, [the Times puzzle] tested classical knowledge. I will add more updated subjects - TV, movies, modern slang, modern names in the news... I want to be a little more modern, to embrace everybody,&rdquo; he told Baltimore Sun in a 1993 interview.</p>
