##### 1. Collecting the Data
I saved the json files from Dylan O' Shea's public Gitub account and used the local paths to create a dataframe of all the terms till 2015. The data is saved in slangtill2015.csv. 

I scraped the data from 2015-2020 from XWordInfoTo since the Github JSON files were missing several dates from 2015 onwards. To see how I scraped data from XWordInfo, to to <b> Python Analysis/XWordInfo_scraping.ipynb</b> I saved the dataframes into a csv (crossword_year_2015_2021.csv and crossword_year_2022)

##### 2. Poking at the data
Crosswords.ipynb was my prelim analysis (this notebook only analyzes a subset of the whole data)- most of the analysis isn't focused on the story that I wrote, rather it was the path to the analysis I did for my story - but this notebook is more interesting than the other one. "More Crossword Analysis.ipynb" was what I used for the story: I expanded the dataset to include all the years till 2022 and used it to create .csv's to create visuals on datawrapper. 

##### 3. Visuals
Graph1, Graph2 and Graph3 are the visuals in the order as they are seen in the report. They were created in Datawrapper, edited in Illustrator and uploaded to html using ai2html.js.

Apart from the sources that I have listed, I messaged a few NYT Crossword constructors on Twitter who were incredibly kind with their time: Aimee Lucido, Will Nediger and Robyn Weintraub. While Aimee and Will are featured in the story, Robyn's comments were about social media and word lists -> an angle I didn't have too much time to research and explore for this piece but a important topic to address in the future
